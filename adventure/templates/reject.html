The car door opens, and you get out. You text everyone else in the CSSI group chat,
and they do not respond. You notice that the google office is oddly quiet,
there is not a single other person in sight, and your bus home has not arrived.
The google car is still open.

What do you do?

<ul>
  <li><a href = "/jumpin">Jump In</li>
  <li><a href = "/ignore">Ignore</li>
